1/26/05 ideas for experiments, discussed w/ Anil

Baseline data: paced and continuation tapping of individuals in isolation (with/without self-feedback)

Questions: make all the sounds the same (timbre and or loudness) vs individuating tappers
Self feedback distinct? Computer pacing distinct?

Network ideas: control #inputs each node gets
local only
ring

manipulations: examine dynamics when isolating a node, removing connections, changing connections,
adding induction to new nodes

Leader follower dynamics--how expressed? Louder taps / leading timing e.g.
